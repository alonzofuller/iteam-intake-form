================================================================================
🚀 DEPLOY YOUR FORM TO GITHUB PAGES (MOST RELIABLE METHOD)
================================================================================

Since Netlify drag-and-drop had issues, let's use GitHub Pages instead.
It's FREE, reliable, and your form is already prepared!

✅ Git repository is already initialized
✅ All files are committed and ready
✅ This will take about 10 minutes

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the prompts to create a FREE account
4. Verify your email address

(If you already have a GitHub account, skip to Step 2)


STEP 2: Create a New Repository
--------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill out the form:

   Repository name: iteam-intake-form
   Description: Client intake form for iTeam Legal Solutions
   ✓ Public (keep this selected)
   ✗ Do NOT initialize with README (uncheck all boxes at bottom)

3. Click "Create repository"


STEP 3: Connect Your Local Files to GitHub
-------------------------------------------
GitHub will show you instructions. We'll use the "push an existing repository" method.

Copy the repository URL shown (it looks like):
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/iteam-intake-form.git

Now, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run these commands:

1. Navigate to your form folder:
   cd "C:\Users\alonz\Downloads\Claude Code Dev\sponsor-intake-form"

2. Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/iteam-intake-form.git

3. Rename the branch to main:
   git branch -M main

4. Push your files to GitHub:
   git push -u origin main

   (You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password)
   Note: For password, you may need to use a Personal Access Token instead


STEP 4: Enable GitHub Pages
----------------------------
1. Go to your repository on GitHub:
   https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/iteam-intake-form

2. Click "Settings" (top menu)

3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"

4. Under "Source":
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: select "main"
   - Folder: select "/ (root)"

5. Click "Save"

6. Wait about 2 minutes

7. Refresh the page - you'll see a message:
   "Your site is live at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/iteam-intake-form/"


STEP 5: Test Your Form
-----------------------
1. Visit your live URL:
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/iteam-intake-form/

2. Fill out the form with test data

3. Submit it

4. Check your email: alonzofuller5957@gmail.com

5. Click the confirmation link in the FIRST email from Formspree


================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: I CAN DO IT FOR YOU (NEEDS YOUR GITHUB INFO)
================================================================================

If you have a GitHub account, I can automate this process for you!

Just tell me:
1. Your GitHub username
2. I'll give you commands to run that will deploy it automatically

OR

Create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Deploy Intake Form"
4. Check: "repo" (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with ghp_)
7. Give me the token and I'll deploy it for you

================================================================================
EASIEST OPTION: USE VERCEL INSTEAD
================================================================================

Vercel has better drag-and-drop support. Try this:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Sign up with GitHub (easiest)
3. Click "Add New..." > "Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository OR
5. Use "Deploy from templates" > "Other" > Upload files manually

Their upload is more reliable than Netlify's!

================================================================================
LOCAL TESTING (WORKS RIGHT NOW)
================================================================================

You can test your form locally while deciding on deployment:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\alonz\Downloads\Claude Code Dev\sponsor-intake-form
3. Double-click: index.html
4. Form opens in your browser
5. Fill it out and test (submissions will work!)

This works for testing but won't give you a shareable URL.

================================================================================
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?
================================================================================

Option A: Follow the GitHub Pages instructions above (most reliable)
Option B: Give me your GitHub credentials and I'll deploy it for you
Option C: Try Vercel instead (has better upload)
Option D: Just use it locally for now (works but no shareable URL)

Your form is 100% ready - we just need to get it online!
